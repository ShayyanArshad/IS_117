Hello, my name is Shayyan Arshad. I am a junior majoring in Business and
Information Systems. I enjoy messing about with existing code for websites and
modifying it to accomplish my end task. This sometimes includes scraping data
using javascript or just using the code as a template to create a different
website which is faster to build. After completing this course, I hope to be
able to enhance my core web development skills and use them in my career as a
developer.
